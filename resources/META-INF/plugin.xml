  <p>
This is a Webstorm plugin for Javascript deep-type-inference-based property completion and annotation.
  </p>
  <p>
As you may know, by default Webstorm suggests any property ever defined in your project when you ask for completion in someVar. no matter in what context.
  </p>
  <p>
You may check the "Only type-based completion" flag in settings, but you will quickly notice that there is no completion in some places that could have it.
  </p>
  <p>
For example, arguments of functions like map, filter, reduce, sort and functions defined by user won't get completion.
  </p>
  <p>
So, that's why I'm writing this plugin - to make it possible to code in js as comfortable as you would in some static-typed language with the help of type inference and doc-comments.
  </p>
  <p>
This plugin will be highly inspired by my other plugin, <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9927-deep-assoc-completion">deep-assoc-completion</a> and most features will be borrowed from there
  </p>
