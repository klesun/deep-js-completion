I can't find how to extend Webstorm's type resolver, so I have no choice but to re-implement it...

Well, at least this gives me some flexibility, like calling complex type resolution only when explicitly asked for completion. 

Also, the icon will always be there to show user when I could accomplish what Webstorm could not =3
